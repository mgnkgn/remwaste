# Skip Selection UI

This project is a React-based UI for selecting skip sizes, filtering options, and sorting by various criteria. It fetches data dynamically and allows users to filter their selection based on road allowance, heavy waste permission, and pricing.

## ðŸ›  Features

- **Dynamic Skip Data**: Giving the feeling of fetching skip sizes and details from an API with loading skeletons.
- **Sorting**: Users can sort by price and skip size.
- **Filtering**: Allows filtering skips that are road-legal or permit heavy waste.
- **Selection System**: Highlights the selected skip with a confirmation indicator.
- **Responsive Design**: Works across different screen sizes with tailwind css.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
